- 👋 Hi, I’m Victoria, @citritica. I'm a Spanish girl who studied Communication; not Telecommunications, no, the other communication (Advertising and Public Relations, mostly). 
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my career since I love the idea of helping others and creating solutions.
- 📖 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, but I would love to learn any helpful stuff.
- 🙏 I’m not looking to collaborate on anything special right now. I've just started with programming, so little by little.
- 📫 You will find me in LinkedIn (vgarciaverd) and Instagram (citritica).
